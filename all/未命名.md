  we mainly use synchronous communication and request-response service interaction through API Gateway. 

Each microservice operation, such as viewing travel information, booking, and confirming booking, is exposed as a RESTful API through API Gateway. Users send HTTP requests to API Gateway through front-end applications. After receiving the request, API Gateway triggers the corresponding Lambda function to perform the operation and return the processing result. Under this design, API Gateway is responsible for service routing and traffic management, and Lambda is responsible for actual business logic processing. When executing business logic, each Lambda function communicates with the database through DynamoDB API to obtain and modify relevant data. 

The design ensures efficient communication between each service while following the design principles of statelessness and easy scalability.
